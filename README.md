# Amazon Connect Contact Lens Rules Library

Many businesses today use [Amazon Connect Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-rules.html), a feature of [Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/), through Amazon Connect console for creating and managing rules. Though it’s easy to enable the feature, customers require guidance to build the amazon connect contact lens rules. They have challenges in realizing the value of the feature and need a set of rule templates as guidance for experimenting with their business use case similar to the sample set of contact flows out of the box.

With Amazon Connect Rules, contact center managers, supervisors, and quality analysts can automatically categorize contacts, send email notifications or dashboard alerts about customer escalations, prompt tips in agent desktop, and assign tasks for different roles in a contact center. These actions are automated based on conditions that businesses can define such as keywords used on a contact, sentiment trend of a contact, frequent interruptions by agent, agents being silent for long-periods, filtering specific contact attributes or queues, and many more. Rules also provides third-party integrations with leading CRM vendors such as Salesforce and Zendesk that allows you to trigger a task whenever a new case or ticket is created in Salesforce’s CRM or Zendesk’s ticket management system. You can automatically assign these tasks to agents or supervisors based on the case or ticket created and alert them to take necessary action. 

# Contact Lens

Contact Lens for Amazon Connect, a feature of [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/), provides a set of conversational analytics and quality management capabilities, powered by machine learning, that helps understand and classify the sentiment, trends, and compliance of your conversations. These contact center analytics can be used to take action, addressing customer issues, improving agent performance, and identifying crucial company and product feedback. You can more easily search call and chat transcripts, analyze sentiment, identify issues, and monitor agent performance in real-time. Contact Lens also helps you define and assess agent performance criteria (such as adherence to required scripts) and automatically complete evaluation forms. This reduces the need for managers to do manual reviews while more easily identifying coaching needs for your agents.

## Creating Contact Lens Rules using AWS CLI
- Replace "YOUR_INSTANCE_ID" with your unique Amazon Connect Instance ID.
